# Word Finder 
### Would work for screabble but, designed for 4 pics 1 word
A simple python script to find words based on a given length and a series of possible letters. Written in python 3 it utilizes a dictionary I copied from osx. (included)
Intented as a fun quick little project to refresh my python skills there is much room for improvemnt. All pull requests welcome and the code is fully commented :)
- Functions using a simple brute force dictionary matching method.
- Accounts for multiple interesting edge cases.
